<h2>Theory</h2>
<p>
<p>
<i>CRiSP Harvest is an empirically based 
stochastic model simulating fish 
survival over a complete life-cycle.</i>
<p>
CRiSP Harvest is an accounting device 
for tracking the fate of individual 
chinook salmon cohorts through 
time. The annual computational 
cycle consists of the following 
steps:
<ul>
<li>population aging

<li>natural ocean mortality

<li>preterminal (ocean) fishing mortality

<li>maturation

<li>terminal (river) fishing mortality

<li>pre-spawning mortality (inter-dam losses)

<li>production of progeny in the next year.
</ul>

Population aging occurs at the 
start of each year. The model is 
seeded with initial cohort sizes for 
all stocks. The maximum age for 
all stocks is fixed at five years.
<p>
Ocean survival rates for ages one 
through five are assumed constant 
for all stocks (currently set at 0.5, 
0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, respectively). Survival rates to age one 
(also called brood year survival 
rates, or "EV scalars" for Environmental Variability) are estimated during the calibration 
process. Brood year survival rates 
during simulation years can be 
deterministic or stochastic.
<p>
Fishing mortalities during preterminal and terminal fisheries 
include both legal catches and 
incidental mortalities, which 
include "shakers" (sub-legal sized 
fish caught and released during 
chinook fisheries) and "CNRs" 
(legal and sub-legal sized fish 
caught and released during "chinook non-retention" fisheries 
directed at other species, such as 
coho).
<p>
Maturation rates are stock and 
age specific for all stocks. Some 
stocks have variable maturation 
rates.
<p>
Production functions for both 
hatchery and natural stocks are 
estimated from historical data. 
Changes in hatchery production 
can be simulated, as well as supplementation (the release of artificially propagated fish in streams 
to increase or establish natural 
spawning fish populations).
<p>
Model parameters, including cohort sizes, age specific harvest rates, maturity schedules, and incidental fishing mortality rates, are estimated by a technique known as "cohort analysis" or "virtual population analysis." This type of analysis involves the reconstruction of an annual series of abundance estimates using catch and escapement data and making assumptions about natural and incidental mortalities. Coded-wire-tag (CWTs) placed in the snouts of millions of salmon smolts over the past two decades and their subsequent recovery in fisheries, at hatchery racks, and on spawning grounds provide the necessary data for run reconstructions.
<p>
Model parameters can be obtained from the PSC Chinook Technical Committee, or advanced users can utilize there own parameters. Parameters are stored in temporary files in ASCII text format which can be read by CRiSP Harvest without modification (with the exception of one file which must be translated from binary format to ASCII format).
