The following description is taken from CTC (1988).<p>

The calculation of incidental mortalities associated with size limit restrictions depends critically upon the estimation of the proportion
 of each stock that is vulnerable (PV) in a particular fishery by age. Available data are not sufficient to permit estimation of stock-specific PVs.
 Therefore, age-size distributions for large fishing areas were calculated from available data. CWT recoveries turned out to be the best source of this type of age-length data.
 This is because these data belong to a large (and easily available) data set that can be identified accurately as to age and catch location.
 A description of the procedure used to estimate the proportion vulnerable by age follows.<p>
