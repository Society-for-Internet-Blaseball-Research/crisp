CRiSP Harvest is being used at the University of Washington to analyze the potential impacts of proposed harvest management strategies to help recover Snake River fall chinook stocks listed under the Endangered Species Act.
CRiSP Harvest for Sun SPARCstations is available to a network of state, federal and public agencies and tribes in Idaho, Oregon and Washington. The new PC version (currently in beta-testing) will make CRiSP Harvest available to the general public.
