Information On: North/Central BC Stock (Model Stock #2)
<p>

<P>
The North/Central stock group represents all BC stocks north of
Vancouver Island.  The major rivers represented in this group consist
of the Skeena, the Nass, the Atnarko and the Kitimat Rivers.  This
stock is primarily made up of spring and summer run fish, although
some fall or late summer runs are known to occur in the central coast
(south of the Skeena).  These stocks appear to largely stream-type
(one year fresh water residence) and late maturing (predominant ages
at return are ocean age 3 and 4).  Ocean-type fish are more common in
the central coast than in the north coast.  The size of this stock is
not certain.  Visual Fishery Officer estimates sum to about 50,000
pieces during the 79-82 base period, but this is likely an
underestimate.  Currently, this stock is undergoing an increase and
visual estimates approximate 100,000 pieces.  Large enhancement
projects have been mainly limited to the Bella Coola and Kitimat
drainages.  Both these facilities have egg capacities in the range of
3 to 5 million eggs and have not achieved full returns as yet.

<P>
Tag recoveries indicate that the distribution of ocean
catch is mainly in the North BC and Alaskan troll fisheries,
with important catches in the North/Central BC net and sport fisheries.
These latter catches are divided between captures of out-migrating
juveniles and in-migrating adults.  The basic management goals for this
stock grouping are to increase fisheries on surplus wild and hatchery
fish for native and sport harvest.

<P>
Three brood years of tag codes have been summarized to provide the
background harvest information for this stock grouping.  The tag codes
come from the Bella Coola and Kitimat hatcheries as follows:

<PRE>
        BY 76   022016  Kitimat
                022017  Kitimat
                022018  Kitimat

        BY 77   022020  Kitimat
                022021  Kitimat
                022022  Kitimat
                022048  Bella Coola

        BY 78   021614  Bella Coola
                021732  Kitimat
</PRE>

<P>
The brood years selected were chosen to fully cover the base period in
the model and these tag codes are the only ones available for these
brood years.  Because these codes come from the central coast only,
only one stock group can be formed.  There are no useable tag codes
from the Skeena or the Nass to make a separate Skeena/Nass stock.  The
major problem with all these codes is the lack of any escapement data.
In order to estimate escapements for this stock, the maturity schedule
from the upper Georgia Strait stock was used (this is the oldest stock
among the input groups).


<!Page "FraserEarly">
<p>
Information On: Fraser River Early Stock (Model Stock #3)

<P>
The Fraser River divides naturally into three large groupings.  These
are the Fraser River above Hope, the Thompson River drainage (the
largest tributary) and the Harrison (Late) component.  Almost all
stocks returning above Hope enter the lower river before September,
with a major peak occuring in late June or early July.  It is
hypothesized that this peak corresponds with the large runds returning
to uppermost areas above Prince George (these include the Nechako, the
Bowron, Slim Creek, and Tete-Jaune).  However, there is considerable
migration into the river by chinook throughout the summer.  Stocks
which return later (but are still considered summer runs) include the
Chilko, the Quesnel, and most of the runs returning to the Thompson
drainage.  Fresh-water life history scale patterns indicate taht most
upper Fraser stocks appear to be yearling salt-water migrants.  They
are also an older stock with the primary ages at return being ocean
age 3 and 4.  However, stocks which spawn in the Thompson drainage are
mixed, with the far-north migrating Shuswap stock migrating to the
ocean during the first summer and returning predominantly as ocean age
3 fish.  Stocks which spawn in the interior dry-belt (e.g., Nicola
River) migrate as yearlings and return as ocean age 2 fish.

<P>
Escapement stock size estimates are visual estimates made by field
personnel during peak spawning periods.  They are likely to be
underestimates (as is usual with these types of estimates).  Tables 7
to 10 in the 1985 CTC Agency Report summarize the visual estimates to
the various sub-groupings.  The average count for the entire run above
Hope during the 79-82 base period is 43,000.  The current estimate is
in the order of X0,000 to X0,000.  There are major enhancement
facilities ont he Quesnel River (about 3 million eggs) and on the
Eagle River (South Thompson drainage / 2 million eggs).  Other
facilities are scattered, are smaller, and are mainly in the Thompson
drainage basin.  The total hatchery production capacity in the upper
Fraser is X,000,000 eggs.
<P>
Wild tagging was attempted in the upper Fraser for 3 to 4 years in
succession.  Tag recoveries have been almost uniformly poor.  Tags
applied on the Chilko and Tete-Jaune stocks have had survival to
recovery values of less than 0.1% and more than half of the survival
has been escapement (expansion of Petersen mark/recovery estimates).
The few fishery recoveries have been scattered between the Georgia
Strait sport, an occasional northern troll recovery, and the Fraser
terminal gillnet fishery.  Tagging in the Thompson drainage has been
relatively more successful and recovery rates int he ocean fisheries
have been about 0.3%.  The recoveries indicate that these fish are
true far-north migrating stocks being caught predominantly in the
North BC and Alaska troll fisheries.  They also show up in all the
approach net fisheries (including Puget Sound) and have relatively few
contributions to the Georgia Strait fisheries.  The stated escapement
goal for this stock is 96,000 (Table 4, 1985 CTC Agency Report).
Management goals for this stock include establishing directed in-river
sport fisheries on identified surplus fish.  These stocks are also
harvested by native fisheries (which may partially explain the lack of
tag recoveries for the Chilko and Tete-Jaune stocks).
<P>
There are at least 16 codes ranging from the 75 to the 79 brood years
which were applied to wild Fraser stocks.  Of these, the following 6
codes were used:
<pre>
        BY 78   021602  Chilko
                021658  Chilko
                021625  Shuswap
                021638  Shuswap

        BY 79   021601  Shuswap
                021755  Shuswap

</pre>
These codes were selected entirely on the basis of actual contribution
numbers.  Other codes supplied so few recoveries (either because not
enough were marked or the survival was poor) that their use would not
affect the estimated harvest rates.  Again, there were insufficient
data to distinguish between the Thompson drainage stock and the upper
Fraser stock.  Escapement data were collected from both the above
spawning stocks in 1983 and 1984.  Therefore, there are estimates of
age 4 and age 5 spawners only.  The age 5 estimates were allowed to
stand (as these have to be assumed in the calculation procedure).
However, the age 4 estimate for the 1979 brood year Shuswap appeared
to be extremely low.  Therefore, the same calculation method as used
for the North BC stock was used to estimate all other escapements.

<P>
It has long been known that there is a distinct fall run of chinook to
the Fraser.  It peaks in the lower river in the last week of September
and the fish all have a white flesh colour.  The latter characteristic
is traceable in the commercial sale information from the terminal
gillnet fishery as white-fleshed chinook are sold at a different price
and are kept separate on the fish tickets.  In the past, this stock
has supported substantial directed large-mesh gillnet fisheries, with
catches of 10,000 to 20,000 recorded in single 12-hour openings.
<P>
This stock appears to be concentrated entirely in the short section of
the Harrison River between harrison Lake and the confluence with the
Fraser River (about 20 kilometers).  It is unknown if fish migrate
past this section into upper reaches of the drainage.  This stock is
entirely ocean-type and appears to be a relatively early maturing
stock with a large proportion of age 3 (ocean age 2) fish.  Juvenile
fish do not appear to rear at all in the spawning stream.  Instead,
fry migration studies record substantial chinook fry migrations in the
lower Fraser River (these usually peak in mid-April).  The fry all
appear to be recently emerged.  The hypothesized life history for this
stock assumes that it invades available habitat throughout the lower
Fraser, in particular the tidal marshes of the estuary, where they
have been shown to reside up to six weeks.  Visual counts of the
spawning stock by Fishery Officers have ranged from estimates of less
than 10,000 in the mid-60's to mid-70's to 20,000 to 40,000 in the
80's.  Petersen mark/recovery estimates made since 1984 indicate that
the spawning stock may range up to 150,000.  Estimates of total fry
migration in the mid-7o's seemed to indicate at that time that the
spawning stock could be 5 to 10 times larger than the Fishery Officer
estimate in order to account for the size of the fry migration.  The
stated escapement goal is 175,000 as measured with a Petersen estimate
(Table 4 of the 1985 CTC Agency Report).  Management goals include the
establishment of a terminal sport fishery directed at the large jack
population of this stock and to surplus fish when available.
<P>
Enhancement on this stock has occurred on the Chehalis River (a
tributary of the Harrison) and on the Chilliwack River (on the south
side of the Fraser).  The Chehalis has an egg target of 1,000,000
chinook eggs and the Chilliwack takes about 3,000,000 chinook eggs.
However, the Chehalis hatchery has had very poor survivals of chinook
within the hatchery (less than 40%) due to an endemic disease problem.
The Chilliwack hatchery is trying to establish red-fleshed summer runs
into that river (the native run thas disappeared) and expects to
gradually phase out the rearing of white-fleshed chinook.
<P>
This stock was the first stock tagged with coded wire tags in the 1971
brood years.  However, this tag data cannot be used because the
recovery program was not in full development at the time the tags
returned.  Tagging did not resume on this stock until the 1981 brood
year, when experimental hatchery releases were made from the Chehalis
and the Chilliwack hatcheries.  Ocean tag returns from these releases
indicate that this stock contributes substantially to all fisheries
inside Georgia Strait (40% of the recoveries), to the west coast of
Vancouver Island (30% of the recoveries), and to the approach net
fisheries (including Puget Sound net 15% of the recoveries).  The tag
codes used are:

<pre>
        BY 81   022163  Chilliwack
                022205  Chehalis

</pre>
No escapement data are available for either of these stocks.  When the
maturity schedules for fall-run Georgia Strait stocks (Big Qualicum)
were used to estimate the escapement, a total harvest rate of nearly
90% was calculated.  This was because of the large (terminal) net
harvest rate on the lower Fraser stock when compared to the Georgia
Strait stock.  However, the maturity schedule used was arbitrarily
chosen such that the resultant total harvest rate would be near 80%.
See Appendix for details of the calculations.  In order to scale the
base period escapement to the stated optimum (which is based on the
Petersen estimates), the visual estimates were multiplied by 6, which
the average of the ratio of the Petersen estimates to the visual
estimates over the period 1982 to 1985 (earlier multiplications are
based on expansions of intensive dead pitch activities).

There is a considerable hatchery stock associated with the west coast
Vancouver Island stock grouping.  Approximately 9M fingerlings are
released annually from the Robertson Creek hatchery on the Somass
River.  Another 1.5M fingerlings are released by the Nitinat hatchery
and it is expected that the Conuma hatchery in Tahsis Inlet will
release another 1.5M fingerlings.  Calculation of the optimum and the
productivity parameters for this stock is given in the productivity
section of the documentation.  The same tag codes were used to
calculate the harvest rates as for the naturally spawning stocks.

This stock grouping represents all stocks which spawn on the west
coast of Vancouver Island.  Although this group of stocks is dominated
by the Somass River stock (Barkley Sound), there are other stocks of
importance in the Nitinat River, the Kennedy River, the Gold River,
and the Marble River.  As in most area of BC, escapement estimates are
obtained through visual counts by field personnel.  These counts are
not obtained through any established or rigorous methodology and
probably constitute an underestimate of stock size.  The escapement is
complicated by the presence of the Robertson Creek hatchery.  The base
period naturally spawning escapement is estimated to be about 7500
pieces by visual estimate.  Recent (1984-1986) work using various
mark/recapture estimation procedures place the natural spawning stock
in the 40,000 to 70,000 range.  The escapement objective for this
stock is stated at 91,000.  This includes an objective of 70,000 for
the naturally spawning portion of the Somas, which is based on the
stock sizes seen by the 1984 Petersen estimate.
<P>
All biological information from this area indicate that this stock is
a fall run stock with ocean ages 2 and 3 predominating.  Almost all
juvenile migration occurs in the spring and early summer
(sub-yearling).  This stock is a far-north migrating stock based on
the distribution of fishery tag recoveries which show that 60% occur
in the North BC and Alaska troll fisheries.  Another 11% of the
recoveries occur in the west coast Vancouver Island troll fishery, and
outside net recoveries account for another 7%.  There are substantial
terminal net and sport fisheries which account for 17% of the input
data recoveries.
<P>
The CWT codes used to construct the input stock data all come from
Robertson Creek hatchery codes.  The same codes used in the 1984
version of the model were used in the 86/87 version.  The codes used
were:
<pre>
        BY 74   020606
                020609

        BY 75   020408
                020409

        BY 76   021630
                021631

        BY 77   022217
                022218
</pre>
<P>
The codes used are the production codes associated with each brood
year.  More brood years were used for this stock than in other input
stocks because some changes occurred in the collection of rack
information after 1981.  Accordingly, it was feared that using the
more recent brood years would bias the estimates of harvest rates.
However, data from the older brood years were not considered to be as
representatiive of the harvest patterns to be simulated by the PSC
model.  Therefore, all the brood years used were averaged as a
compromise.
<P>
In order to calculate a base period escapement for this stock that
would be in the same ratio as the stated optimum, the visual estimates
for the naturally spawning fraction of the Somass River were increased
by a factor of 5.  This factor is approximately the ratio of the 1984
Petersen estimate to the 1984 visual observation estimate.

Information On: Upper Georgia Strait Stock (Model Stock #7)
<P>

<P>
Georgia Strait consists of at least two distinct groups of stocks.
These two groups are the rivers flowing into the Strait of Georgia
along the east coast of Vancouver Island and the rivers flowing into
the mainland inlets on the other side of the Straits.  The rivers
flowing into Johnstone Strait (both east and west sides) form a third
grouping of stocks which is allied with the Georgia Strait stocks.
The 1984 version of the PSC model lumped all three of these stock
groupings into a single stock for modeling purposes.  The 1986/87
version has divided the Johnstone Strait grouping away from the
Georgia Strait stock groups, largely on the basis of tag recoveries
from the Quinsam hatchery.
<P>
The upper Georgia Strait stock group represents all rivers flowing
into the top of Georgia Strait including the upper mainland inlets
(Puntledge River, Campbell/Quinsam River, Bute River, and Southgate
River), Johnstone Strait (Klinaklini River, Nimpkish River), and Queen
Charlotte Strait (Kingcome River, Keough River).  This is a diverse
group of stocks for which little biological data are available.  It is
suspected that the majority of stocks which spawn in the large, cold,
and poorly productive streams of the mainland inlets are yearling
migrants which have a far-north migration pattern.  They are slo
primarily spring and summer run fish.  The primary age at return would
be ocean age 3 and 4.  Stocks returning to Vancouver Island streams
are mainly fall and late summer run and appear to be summer or late
spring (fingerling) migrants, but they also have the far-north
migration pattern and appear to be mainly ocean age 3 and 4 at
maturity, with a significant component of ocean age 5 as well.  Stock
abundance estimates are extremely unreliable due to the remoteness of
many of the large rivers and to the quantity of glacial till which
colour the river waters.  Visual estimates are also difficult to time
so that peak spawning periods are covered.  The total estimated
spawning stock averaged 11,500 pieces during the base period and the
stated escapement goal is 23,000 (Table 4 of the 1985 CTC Agency
Report does not sub-divide the total Georgia Strait goal).  These
numbers include river spawning in the Quinsam, Campbell and Puntledge
Rivers.  There are no specific management goals for this stock
grouping apart from maintaining current fishing levels in local areas.
Enhancement in this stock group is centered about the Quinsam hatchery
with an egg target of 2,000,000 eggs.  Total production capacity of
all facilities is X,000,000 eggs.
<P>
Tag returns from the Quinsam hatchery establish the far-north
migration pattern for this stock and the older average age of
maturation.  The majority of the fishery recoveries for this stock
come from the North BC and Alaska troll fisheries (45% of the
recoveries) and from the net fisheries of Johnstone Strait, North BC
and Alaska (40% of the recoveries).  The balance of the recoveries
come from miscellaneous fisheries, particularly the sport fisheries of
North BC considerable sport fishery which develops around the estuary
of the Campbell River in the fall.
<P>
The tag codes used in the 1986/87 version of the model are the same as
used in the 1984 version.  The following codes were used:
<pre>
	BY 77	021736	Quinsam
		021737	Quinsam
		021738	Quinsam

	BY 78	021759	Quinsam
</pre>
These codes are the production codes associated with this hatchery
during those two brood years.  Escapement data are routinely collected
at this hatchery, including some (unknown) fraction of strays below
the hatchery in both the Quinsam and Campbell Rivers.  Escapement
below the hatchery was doubled to account for the estimated coverage
during the recovery effort.  This expansion factor is the average of
the river coverage fraction estimated from mark/recovery work from
1984 to 1986.
<P>
The visual escapement data for 1986 in the mainland inlet area of upper Georgia Strait (Area 13) was also adjusted for the purposes of modeling input.  This was done because it appeared that the field staff had made an extremely large count of spawners in the main river of this area (Southgate River) primarily due to the coincidence of very clear observation conditions, good weather, and peak spawning period.   All other counts in the other areas of this stock grouping showed declines or modest increases.  Therefore the average relative change from 1985 to 1986 for all other systems in the upper Georgia Strait stock group was used to adjust the 1985 visual estimate for Area 13.

The rivers covered by this stock grouping include all rivers flowing
into Georgia Strait from a point about midway down the east coast of
Vancouver Island (Big and Little Qualicum Rivers, Nanaimo River,
Chemainus River, and Cowichan River).  It also includes the lower
inlets on the east side of Georgia Strait (Toba River, Jervis River,
and Squamish River).  These rivers were lumped with the upper Georgia
Strait stock in the 1984 version of the PSC model.  In order to
calculate base period escapements and escapement goals, the hatchery
production had to be separated from the naturally occurring spawning.
For the Lower Georgia Strait stock grouping, all river escapements
were including in the naturally spawning fraction.  Rack returns for
the Big Qualicum and Capilano only were included in the hatchery
escapements.  The base period escapement for this stock was 17,000 and
the stated escapement goal is 33,000.  Management goals are as for the
upper Georgia Strait stock (see above).
<P>
The Vancouver Island streams from this stock appear to be late fall
run stocks with a limited northward migration pattern.  A significant
proportion of these fish appear to reside throughout their marine life
in Georgia Strait itself.  The majority of the fish appear to migrate
to sea after less than 3 months of freshwater rearing.  Age at
maturity appears to be divided between ocean age 2 and age 3 with
ocean age 4 almost non-existent.  The mainland inlet stocks are less
well-known with respect to life history patterns.  The Squamish River
used to have yearling migrants and an early fall run timing.  However,
this stock has been badly overfished, and current timing from hatchery
returns indicate that a later fall run pattern currently predominates.
In addition, current data indicate that the Squamish has fingerling
sea-ward migrants.  Information from the other inlet rivers are not
available.
<P>
Tag returns from Big Qualicum and Capilano hatcheries indicate that
70% of the fishery recoveries from this stock occur in Georgia Strait.
Only 99% of the recoveries occur in the northern troll fisheries.
Most of the other recoveries occur in net fisheries, particularly in
Johnstone Strait (8%) and the central area (7%).
<P>
The tag codes used in the 1986/87 version of the model are the same as
used in the 1984 version.  The following codes were used:
<pre>
	BY 77	021639	Capilano
		021642	Capilano
		021726	Big Qualicum
		021727	Big Qualicum

		021613	Big Qualicum
		021656	Big Qualicum
		021728	Capilano
		021729	Capilano
		021730	Capilano
</pre>
These codes are the production codes associated with these hatcheries
during the two brood years.  A fence is maintained at the mouth of the
Big Qualicum River and all tags are recovered at passage through the
fence.  There was some uncertainty associated with the escapement
recoveries from the Capilano hatchery.  Therefore, the escapement
returns from this hatchery were not used in the model input.  Instead,
the annual harvest rate of the Big Qualicum was calculated and applied
to the combined catch data from both hatcheries.

The hatchery production of Georgia Strait was included as a separate
stock in the 86/87 version of the PSC model.  Hatchery rack returns
from Quinsam, Puntledge, Big Qualicum and Capilano were averaged over
the 79-82 base period to calculate the base period escapement.  The
escapement goal calculations and productivity parameter calculations
are shown in productivity section of the documentation.  The same tag
codes as used for the naturally spawning lower Georgia Strait stock
were used to calculate the harvest rates for this stock.  Current
releases for all hatcheries in Georgia Strait total about 19M
fingerlings with an expected maximum under current plans of 20M.

The Nooksack/Samish region is managed for hatchery production during
the return period of fall chinook.  The stock included in the model
represents both natural and hatchery production since it is believed
that the majority of the natural production originates from hatchery
strays.  The average run size and escapement during the base period is
given below.
<P>
The average escapement includes an estimated 218 fish which originated
from yearling production.  Hence, the stock was calibrated to an
escapement of 11,923 fish.  The escapement goal is the average
escapement in 1979-82 minus the estimated average escapement of 218
fish which originated from yearling production (estimate obtained from
the WDF/NBS model).

The escapement goal is equal to the escapement estimated from cohort

<P>
The expansion of the tag group to represent stocks was done slightly
differently for the yearling stocks than for other stocks in Puget
Sound.  This modification was necessary because of the lack of data on
the abundance of the yearling stocks relative to fingerling stocks.
Fish originating from fingerling or yearling production are not
differentiated in the hatchery escapement records.
<P>
In order to estimate the total abundance of yearling stocks, the
recoveries of marked fish were multiplied by an expansion factor
related to the average marked to unmarked ratio.  The expansion factor
was calculated by:
<ol>
<li>Computing the average number of yearlings released (N) during the
   base period;
<li>The expansion factor (Fi) for tag groups within each year was then
   computed by dividing the mean number fo fish released by the number
   of marked fish released and the number of brood years (n) in which
   tagging occurred.

Several methods were utilized to estimate the escapement for the
Skagit tag codes.
<ol>
<li>The terminal catch/escapement ratio from the WDF run
reconstruction;
<li>The maturation rate of the Puget Sound fingerling stock;
<li>The ocean harvest rate of the Puget Sound fingerling stock.
</ol>
The expected escapement computed from the average terminal
catch/escapement ratio was 581 age 3-5 fish.
<pre>

	1979	10,509	    13,605	0.7724
	1980	10,649	    20,345	0.5234
	1981	13,071	     8,670	1.5076

</pre>
The maturation schedule method relied upon maturation rates from the
Puget Sound fingerling stock and an input harvest rate for age 5 fish.
The age 5 harvest rate was selected so that the average escapement
scale for the age 3 and 4 escapements was equal to the age 5
escapement scale.
<pre>
	Age 5 Harvest Rate    =  .6119
	Age 4 Maturation Rate =  .8468
	Age 3 Maturation Rate =  .1500
	Age 2 Maturation Rate =  .0141
</pre>
The ocean harvest rate method utilized the equation:
<pre>
	R = O / (O + E + T)
</pre>
or, solving for E
<pre>
	E = (O - R * (O + T)) / R
</pre>
where O is the ocean catch, E is the age 3 through 5 escapement, T is
the terminal catch, and R is the ocean harvest rate.  The ocean
harvest rate of the Puget Sound fingerling stock was on the assumption
that it would be similar to that of the Skagit stock.  The expected
escapement for the Skagit is given by:
<pre>
	E = 3,217 - (.58) * (3,850) / .58  =  1,697
</pre>
The first method resulted in a harvest rate (total harvest rate equal
to .8634 without shakers) which appeared to be unrealistically high
given the stability of the escapement for the stock.  Method 2 gave a
lower ocean harvest rate than the Puget Sound fingerling stock, which
also seemed unreasonable.  Method 3 was selected because it resulted
in realistic ocean, terminal, and total harvest rates.
<P>
Results from the above CWT experiments show the principal fisheries
harvesting these stocks outside Puget Sound are the West Coast
Vancouver Island troll fishery and the Georgia Strait sport and troll
fisheries.

The Stillaguamish stock was tagged in brood years 1980 through 1982.
The tag code use in each brood year is given below.  Since no
escapement data were available, the age composition of the Skagit
stock was used for the Stillaguamish stock.

Since the tagging occurred outside of the model base period, the
recoveries were adjusted using the procedure implemented in the
COHSHAK4 program.  This procedure requires that escapement data exist
for each brood year.  No escapement recoveries existed for any of the
Stillaguamish tag codes.  The terminal catch/escapement ratio was used
to estimate the age 3 to 5 escapement for each tag code, and the age
composition of the Skagit escapement was used to distribute the total
escapement among age classes.
<pre>

After COHSHAK4 had been used to convert the tag recoveries to the base
period, the three methods previously discussed for the Skagit were
used to estimate the Stillaguamish escapement.
<P>
The average terminal catch/escapement ratio from 1979 through 1982 was 2.72.

	Average			2.7207
</pre>
Data for the maturation method were identical to those used for the
Skagit River with the exception of the age 5 harvest rate, which was
fit using the technique previously described for the Skagit River.
<pre>
	Age 5 Harvest Rate     =  .8319
	Age 4 Maturation Rate  =  .8468
	Age 3 Maturation Rate  =  .1500
	Age 2 Maturation Rate  =  .0141
</pre>
For the ocean harvest rate method,
<pre>
	E  =  492.3  -  (.58) * (563) / .58  =  286
</pre>
Methods 1 and 2 gave similar results with Method 2 resulting in a
slightly higher total harvest rate.  The escapement resulting from
Method 1 was consistent with tag code data from other Puget Sound
areas given the low contribution rates of the Stillaguamish tag codes.
Use of Method 3 resulted in an escapement which seemed too large given
the data from tag codes in other Puget Sound regions.

CWT releases during the 1977-79 brood year base period for Washington
coastal chinook stocks are limited.  Only the Quinault system had a
program during this period which tagged sufficient numbers of fish to
yield results that were judged suitable for modeling purposes.  It was
felt, however, that this stock could only represent the Quinault

To adjust for potential underestimation of escapement recoveries due
to water flow problems at the Quinault National Fish Hatchery, we
applied this 2:1 ratio to the age 3-5 Washington coastal net catch in
order to obtain an estimate of escapement by age class.  This ratio is
based on the average catch: escapement ratio reported for fall chinook
in the Quinault system during the period 1980-83 when adult recoveries
of the above CWT groups occurred.

GENERAL COMMENTS ON PUGET SOUND/WASHINGTON COASTAL STOCKS
<P>
Modifications to the 1986-87 version of the multi-stock model included
a number of revisions to the input data for Puget Sound and Washington
coastal stocks.  The major modifications which were made are
summarized below:
<ol>
<li>The Puget Sound fall fingerling stock was separated into a natural
   and a hatchery component.  This simplified the addition of new
   hatchery production and the interpretation of model output.
<li>A separate stock was created for production of hatchery and natural
   fall chinook from the Nooksack/Samish region.  The Nooksack/Samish
   stock appears to have a different distribution than South Puget
   Sound and Hood Canal stocks.  Separating it from the remainder of
   Puget Sound provided greater flexibility in modelling changes in
   production and survival.
<li>The Green River fall natural stock was included with the Puget
   Sound fall natural stock aggregate.  The terminal run of the Green
   River stock has been near the escapement goal in recent years.  The
   Green River natural stock was aggregated with other stocks to
   conserve space within the model.
<li>The estimated escapements for the Skagit summer stock, the
   Stillaguamish summer stock, and the Snohomish fall stock were
   modified to provide more realistic exploitation rates.
<li>Tag recovery data from Canadian and Alaska fisheries were updated
   for all stocks.  Washington and Oregon fishery recoveries were
   updated for the Stillaguamish summer and Nooksack spring stocks.
</ol>
Puget Sound and Washington coastal stocks included in the 1988-89
version of the model are listed below:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Nooksack Spring (natural)
<LI>Nooksack/Samish Fall Fingerling (hatchery and natural)
<LI>Skagit Summer (natural)
<LI>Stillaguamish Summer (natural)
<LI>Snohomish Fall (natural)
<LI>Puget Sound Fall Fingerling (hatchery)
<LI>Puget Sound Fall Fingerling (natural)
<LI>Puget Sound Fall Yearling (hatchery)
<LI>Quinault River Fall (hatchery)
</UL>
<P>
The Nooksack Spring, Skagit Summer, Stillaguamish Summer, and
Snohomish Fall stocks were included in the model primarily to evaluate
the effects of alternative management actions upon the rate of
rebuilding.  Other stocks were included primarily to provide realistic
catch levels in model fisheries.
<P>
Puget Sound hatchery chinook releases are characterized by a diverse
number of release times and sizes.  Many of these production
components were not tagged during the base period of the model.  One
approach to overcome this situation would be to identify individual
production components within a stock and assign tag groups to these
production components based on measurable characteristics of the
population.  Lacking well-defined criteria with which to accomplish
this and wishing to minimize the number of assumptions involved in
this analysis, we opted to pool CWT results from all representative
tag groups within a brood year, i.e. simply treat individual
experiments as if they were part of one large tag release.  Cluster
analysis indicated that releases within a production region had a
similar pattern of distribution.
<P>
After combining tag groups within brood year, we weighted each brood
year in order to give it equal representation.  Our objective was to
generate a composite or average picture of the stock's performance
during the base period, discount annual harvest differences, and avoid
reliance on extreme results.  Weighting between brood years was
accomplished by standardizing the catch level for each brood,
i.e. scaling the total catch (excluding escapement) to some arbitrary
level, in this case, maximum total brood year catch.  In some
instances, there was only one brood year available for a stock and
this step was omitted.
<P>
Two further adjustments were necessary to transform the CWT recoveries
into input data usable by the model.  First, because CWT recoveries in
the escapement are generally underestimated, we applied correction
factors in the form of terminal net catch escapement ratios to
estimate the expected escapement recoveries for a stock (catch and
escapement data were obtained from the WDF run reconstruction dated
7/21/86).  The total recoveries in the North Puget Sound Net and Other
Puget Sound Net fisheries of tags from fish of age 3 through 5 were
multiplied by the average catch/escapement ratio to obtain the
expected escapement for the tag groups.
<P>
Second, the Puget Sound fall fingerling, Puget Sound fall natural, and
Puget Sound yearling are stock aggregates which consist of a number of
distinct stocks.  For example, the Puget Sound yearling stock
aggregate includes production from the Skagit River, the Snohomish
River, South Puget Sound, and Hood Canal.  Since the stock aggregate
should reflect the relative abundance of each component, it was
necessary to weight the CWT recovery estimates for each stock to
obtain the correct mixture within the stock aggregate.  To accomplish
this, a scale factor was computed based on the ratio of total
escapement to the CWT escapement estimates.

GENERAL COMMENTS ON COLUMBIA RIVER STOCKS
<P>
Chinook populations entering the Columbia River are divided by return
timing into spring, summer and fall segments.  The spring and fall
returns are divided into management units on the basis of ocean
distribution as well as spawning time and age at maturity.
<P>
The multi-stock model harvest rate indicator stocks, representing the
Columbia River chinook populations, did not cover all segments.  The
summer segment and the upper river spring management unit were not
represented due to insufficient numbers of coded wire tagged hatchery
smolts released for these stocks.  In most cases, tag codes were
selected which had a release of at least 100,000 coded wire tags.  All
the Columbia River tag codes used in the model were representative of
production and no experimental tag release groups were used.
