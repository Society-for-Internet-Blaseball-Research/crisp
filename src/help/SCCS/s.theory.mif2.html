Life cycle computations in CRiSP Harvest are performed on an annual basis. The sequence of computations reverses the procedures employed in the cohort analysis used to generate the stock-specific input data. The annual computational sequence is illustrated in <i>Fig. 4.1</i> and outlined below:<p>

Incidental fishing mortalities include "shakers" (sub-legal sized fish caught and released during chinook fisheries) and "CNRs" (legal and sub-legal sized fish caught and released during "chinook non-retention" fisheries directed at other species, e.g., coho).<p>
</a><a name="673300">
The remaining five sections of this chapter describe the functional relationships of the model. Natural survival processes are described first, followed by production processes, fishing processes, catch ceiling management, and in-river management.<p>
</a><a name="673188">
Although many of the parameters are year specific, year indices have been deleted to make the equations easier to interpret. Brief descriptions of all variables follow each equation. More detailed notation and variable definitions are described in Chapter 7 (not available at this time).<p>
