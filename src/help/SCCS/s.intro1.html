<h1> 1.1 -  Welcome</h1>
</a>
Welcome to the Columbia River Salmon Passage (CRiSP) Harvest Model-a user-friendly version of the forecasting portion of the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) Chinook Model. Now you can use the same model scientists from the Pacific Salmon Commission used in 1995 to explore the potential consequences of chinook salmon harvest regulations.<p>

Although the CRiSP Harvest Model is not completely up-to-date with the current model used by the PSC, it contains the most important features of the model and allows users to gain appreciation for the complexities and difficulties of Pacific salmon harvest management. This manual provides step-by-step instructions for examining a variety of processes involved in salmon management. Our hope is that by using the model to simulate management actions, users will learn about these processes.<p>

This first chapter includes a general overview and brief history of the CRiSP Harvest Model. It also includes a section describing mathematical modeling. The second chapter is a detailed Users Manual that will serve as a reference for operating the program. Chapter Three describes several lessons, or tutorials, that demonstrate step-by-step procedures for learning about the fishery processes. Chapter Four includes a brief description of the model theory. <p>
