<h1>2.4 -  Drop-Down Menus</h1>
</a>
All CRiSP Harvest commands are available on a drop-down menu. Many of the commands are also available on the toolbar (described in the next section). More details on these operations is described in <a href="users28.html#709929">"Model Operations."</a>

<b>Menu</b>     <b>Item</b>            <b>What It Does</b>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>File</b>     Print Map..     Prints the current screen.

         Mouse Tool      Opens a dialog box for setting mouse button
                         controls.

         Exit            Exits CRiSP Harvest.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Fishery</b>  PNV..           Opens a dialog box for adjusting "Proportions Non
                         Vulnerable" for each fishery. PNVs are used to
                         simulate changes in size limits in the fisheries.
                         For example, increasing the size limit will
                         increase the proportion of some age classes that
                         are no longer vulnerable to retention by the
                         fishery.

         CNR..           This is currently under development. When
                         implemented, it will open a dialog box for
                         adjusting "Chinook Non-Retention" mortality
                         parameters in some fisheries.

         Catch           Opens a dialog box for adjusting catch ceilings
         Ceilings..      (quotas) in fisheries that have this type of
                         management control. For example, use it to set
                         future catch ceilings in the ocean troll
                         fisheries.

         Fishery Graphs  Opens a sub-menu for producing graphs of fishery
                         statistics over time, including: Abundance Index,
                         Catches (Total, Pre-terminal and Terminal) and
                         Incidental Mortality (Total, Sublegal and Legal).
                         Graphs generated are for the currently selected
                         fishery.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Stock</b>    Inter-Dam       Opens a dialog box for adjusting the "Inter-Dam
         Loss..          Loss" rates for three Columbia River stocks. The
                         IDLs are actually the survival rates from the time
                         the fish leave the river fisheries and arrive on
                         the spawning grounds. Warning: at present only
                         three stocks actually have IDL. The fact that all
                         stocks display is a bug to be corrected in a
                         future release.

         EV Scalars..    Opens a dialog box for adjusting the annual
                         "Environmental Variability" Scalars for each
                         stock. The EV Scalars can be thought of as brood
                         year survival rates that determine the relative
                         spawning success each year.

         Enhancement..   Opens a dialog box for adjusting parameters
                         associated with hatchery stocks.

         Maturation      Opens a dialog box for adjusting maturation rates
         Rates...        for each of the stocks (i.e., the fraction of each
                         age class that returns to spawn in a given year).

         Stock Graphs    Opens a sub-menu for producing graphs of stock
                         statistics over time including: Abundances,
                         Escapements, CNR mortalities (Sublegal and Legal),
                         Catches (Total, Preterminal and Terminal), True
                         Term Run. Graphs generated are for the currently
                         selected stock.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Harvest</b>  Harvest Rate    Opens a dialog box for adjusting annual
         Scalars..       stock/fishery specific harvest rates. For example,
                         to simulate changes in fishery regulations (e.g.,
                         time/area closures) that increase or decrease
                         harvest rates relative to the base period.

         Base Period     Opens a dialog box displaying the
         Harvest         stock/age/fishery specific harvest rates during
         Rates..         the base period (1979-1982). These values cannot
                         be changed. Use Harvest Rate Scalars to adjust
                         harvest rates relative to base period values.

         Mortality       Opens a sub-menu for producing graphs of Total and
         Graphs          Incidental mortality by stock and fishery. Graphs
                         generated are for the currently selected stock and
                         fishery.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Run</b>      Scenario        Runs the model in a scenario mode-a single
                         instance of the model in deterministic mode (i.e.,
                         all parameters are fixed).

         Monte Carlo..   Opens a dialog box where the model is run in a
                         Monte Carlo model. One or more "games" (a game is
                         one instance of the model) are run using a
                         different set of Brood Year Survival Rates (EV
                         Scalars) during each run. The EV Scalars are
                         selected randomly from designated probability
                         distributions. Note: This mode of model operation
                         is still under development for the PC platform.

         Calibrate       Calibrates the model to observed data. Calibration
                         runs require special configuration files that most
                         users will not have.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Help</b>     Contents        Opens a window giving the table of contents 
			 of the CRiSP Harvest help files: README, 
			 FAQ, Model Overview, and CRiSP Harvest 
			 manual. Click on a subject to read about it.


         Glossary	 Opens a window providing definitions for key CRiSP 
			 Harvest terminology (Chapter 2. User's Manual,
			 <a href="users29g.html">Appendix 2.4</a>).

         About CRiSP     Gives the version number of the model.
