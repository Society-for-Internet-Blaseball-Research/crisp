<h1> 1.3 -  Brief History of the PSC Chinook and CRiSP Harvest Models</h1>
</a>
During the negotiations which led to the Pacific Salmon Treaty in 1985, efforts to reach agreement on chinook management focused on strategies which would rebuild depressed natural stocks within an agreed-upon time period. At the technical level, several micro-computer models were developed to provide a method of consistently and objectively analyzing alternative options under consideration during the negotiations.<p>

The computer models were designed to analyze how various combinations of fisheries management actions would affect rebuilding. Prior to the development of the models, information on the production levels for natural chinook stocks was often limited to measurements of catch and escapement in or near the corresponding river of origin. Direct estimates of a significant component of overall production (i.e., harvest levels in ocean and near-shore mixed stock fisheries) were often not available for the natural stocks of interest. By integrating chinook life history assumptions with coded-wire-tag (CWT) recovery data, the models permitted the simulation of ocean and terminal harvest and escapement patterns.<p>

The models simulated the process of rebuilding under hypothetical fishery policies that reduced harvest rates over time. As spawning escapements of depressed stocks increased to optimum levels, production increased. By maintaining fishery regimes, such as harvest ceilings, as run sizes progressively increased, rebuilding accelerated.<p>

The models were initially designed to evaluate alternative fishery management regimes with respect to their implications for successfully rebuilding depressed chinook stocks by 1998. They progressed from simple cohort analyses designed to evaluate overall harvest rates and patterns of exploitation for single stocks or groups of stocks, to a "Multiple Stock Model" which incorporated multiple fisheries, stocks and brood years as well as stock-recruitment production functions. Intermediate steps included a simple "Forward Cohort Analysis" and a "Single Stock" multiple brood and fishery model (also including the stock-recruitment function).<p>

While the "Single Stock" model achieved the goal of providing a set of mutually acceptable rules for evaluating proposals under consideration when the Pacific Salmon Treaty was being negotiated, it did not adequately represent results expected when several stocks were involved. Under the single stock approach, the progressive reductions in harvest rates in fisheries with ceilings resulting from increasing stock size over the course of the rebuilding cycle are transferred entirely to the single stock in the Model. 
In reality, the harvest rate changes in pre-terminal fisheries would be influenced by the abundance of the aggregate of stocks available. However, while the abundance of depressed components of the aggregate would be expected to increase as a result of increased escapement, the abundance of many components would remain relatively stable. As a result, the single stock approach would tend to underestimate the time required for rebuilding; it would present an overly optimistic picture of the effects of future reductions in harvest rates resulting from increased production.<p>

Application of the Model to describe these mechanisms requires the assumption that proportional changes in total model fishery catch are represented by the actual changes in the real world catch. It also assumes that the stock composition in the Model catch reflects the relative contribution of these stocks to the actual catch (the abundance of unrepresented stocks is assumed to be constant).<p>

If these assumptions are not met, the ceiling or quota mechanism on rebuilding will produce incorrect rebuilding schedules. The quota or ceiling mechanism will take effect at different harvest levels for each particular stock depending on the abundance of other stocks in the catch. For example, the rate at which a particular stock rebuilds may be accelerated by the presence of other stocks in the ceiling fisheries. If these other stocks respond to management measures at a faster rate, their abundance is increased and the relative contribution of the stock of interest to the fishery is reduced. This effect is similar to that resulting from enhancement where the increased abundance of hatchery fish will "saturate" the fishery under a fixed harvest ceiling and dilute the impact on wild stocks resulting in an increased savings of wild fish to escapement.<p>

More detailed stratification of fisheries was required to respond to a number of policy questions that were raised over time. The resolution needed for modeling may vary from issue to issue, depending upon the questions to be addressed and the availability of necessary data. The final Model used for the Pacific Salmon Treaty negotiations in 1984 incorporated four stocks and nine fisheries. The Model was modified in 1987 to enable it to simulate up to 25 fisheries and 26 stocks. In 1993 and 1994 the number of stocks was increased to 29 and 30, respectively.<p>

By 1987, the effects of incidental mortality losses to the chinook rebuilding program had increasingly become a matter of concern as management agencies implemented various changes to fishing regulations to increase benefits under the fishery regimes established through the Pacific Salmon Commission. The Model has been modified to more realistically reflect incidental mortality losses and permit the evaluation of regulations such as non-retention restrictions and size limit changes.<p>

The Model was recoded into Microsoft QuickBasic(TM) language beginning in 1986 and was revised in a number of important ways to better meet needs under implementation of the Pacific Salmon Treaty.<p>

The listing of the Snake River Fall Chinook stock as "endangered" under the US Endangered Species Act generated interest in harvest management decisions from stakeholders outside the normal harvest management "family." In 1993 the University of Washington School of Fisheries, with funding from the Bonneville Power Administration, began creating a user-friendly version of the PSC Chinook Model. The goal was to create a tool that both scientists and the general public could use to explore the effects of various harvest management regulations on chinook stock rebuilding.<p>

The new user-friendly model, called the CRiSP Harvest, was initially created under the UNIX operating system and was completed in 1995. Since that time a PC version has been under development to make the model more accessible to the general public. The version described in this manual is still considered a beta (or test) version, so you may encounter problems, or bugs, as you use the program.<p>

The PSC Chinook Technical Committee (CTC) continues to modify the Chinook Model as more information becomes available. This information will be incorporated into the model structure and input data so that the model reflects the current understanding of the dynamics of chinook populations and fisheries. At this time (August 1997) there is no consensus among the CTC members on a calibrated model. The CRiSP Harvest Model described in this manual is based on the last agreed upon model in 1995.<p>
