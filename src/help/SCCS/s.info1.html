<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<i>CRiSP Harvest models the complete life-cycle of 
chinook salmon stocks.</i>
<p>
CRiSP Harvest is a user-friendly computer 
model that simulates the harvest of 
30 chinook salmon stocks by 25 
fisheries over an extended time 
horizon. The geographic range covered by the model extends from 
Southeast Alaska to the Oregon 
coast. Ten stocks and two fisheries 
from the Columbia River basin are 
included in the model.
<p>
The computational engine of 
CRiSP Harvest is based upon the forecasting portion of the Pacific Salmon 
Commission (PSC) Chinook 
Model. A major goal of the Pacific 
Salmon Treaty between the United 
States and Canada is to rebuild 
depressed chinook salmon stocks 
by 1998. The PSC Chinook Technical Committee (CTC) developed 
the Chinook Model to examine 
alternative management approaches 
to implement the PSC chinook 
rebuilding program.
<p>
A key feature of the model is the 
interaction between stocks through 
annual catch ceilings, or quotas, 
imposed upon fisheries that harvest 
multiple stocks. Catch ceilings are 
the primary PSC management tool. 
As stocks rebuild or decline at different rates over time, relative harvest rates in fisheries with catch 
ceilings also change. Single stock 
models cannot simulate this type of 
interaction.
<p>
CRiSP Harvest enhances the features of 
the PSC Chinook Model by providing a graphical interface to view and 
change model parameters, flexible 
code that permits expansion of the 
model, vastly increased computational speed and data storage 
capacity, and a stochastic operational capability providing measures of variability and 
uncertainty in assessing the 
impacts of proposed harvest management actions.
<p>
CRiSP Harvest produces information to 
help managers evaluate the effects 
of changes in environmental factors, such as brood year survival 
rates, and management actions 
designed to assist salmon recovery efforts, including:
<ul>
<li>fishery catch ceilings

<li>fixed escapement goals

<li>stock/fishery specific harvest rate 
 strategies, such as time/area closures

<li>size limits

<li>inter-dam losses during upstream migrations

<li>enhancement activities.
</ul>
<p>
CRiSP Harvest is written in the C++ language and runs on PC computers and Sun SPARCstations, which are powerful UNIX computers.
