<h1>2.7 -  Dialog Boxes</h1>
</a>
Dialog boxes open when sub-menu items with ".." at the end of the name are chosen from the main drop-down menus. The exceptions to this are "Print.." and "Mouse Tool" on the File menu. "Print.." opens a box where you are apprised of printing status. "Mouse Tool" opens a dialog box.<p>

Dialog boxes have several features in common. They are exemplified by the Harvest Rate Scalars dialog box shown here. All of its elements are summarized in the table on the next page.<p>

<img src="usersa47.gif"><p>

In general, these dialog boxes are used to change parameter values. For example, the Proportion Not Vulnerable (PNV) of Age 2 fish in 1996 for the Alaska Troll Fishery can be specifically altered from the default values read into the model at start-up from the <code><b>*.pnv</b></code> file (see <a href="users22.html#711986">"Getting Started"</a>). When the dialog boxes are opened they show the default values. The parameter values are altered individually or in groups by one or more of the following methods:<p>
<ul><a name="703686">
<li>moving sliders
</a><a name="703687">
<li>clicking on scrollbar arrows
</a><a name="703688">
<li>typing in value boxes 
</a><a name="703689">
<li>grouping different parameters so that the change of a single value affects other values absolutely or relatively.
</a>
</ul>
The table that follows shows how these controls work.<p>

<b>Feature</b>     <b>Name</b>     <b>Description</b> (using Harvest Rate Scalars dialog box as an
                     example)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<img src="usersa48.gif">  Fishery  Choose a Fishery to which Harvest Rate Scalars will
                     apply. The drop-down menu has the entire list of
                     Fisheries recognized by the model. When a Fishery is
                     highlighted you can use up and down keys to scroll up
                     and down the list. Note: It is possible to select
                     combinations of Fishery and Stock that never interact.
<img src="usersa49.gif"> Stock    Choose a Stock to which Harvest Rate scalars will apply.
                     The drop-down menu has the entire list of Stocks
                     recognized by the model. When a Stock is highlighted you
                     can use up and down keys to scroll up and down the list.
                     Note: It is possible to select combinations of Fishery
                     and Stock that never interact.
<img src="usersa50.gif">   Year     Toggle on the tabs to display different year groupings.
            groups   (Putting them all on display at once could make the
                     dialog boxes very large!)
<img src="usersa51.gif">    Delta    When checked, all linked values change linearly instead
                     of proportionally, adding the difference between the new
                     and old value to all linked values
<img src="usersa52.gif">       Dulled   The Harvest Rate Scalars for this year are part of the
            Year     calibration data and can not be adjusted from the dialog
                     box
<img src="usersa53.gif">       Bold     The Harvest Rate Scalars for this year can be adjusted
            Year     by using the Slider, Value box, Y box, F box and S box
                     methods described below.
<img src="usersa54.gif"> Slider   Use the slider to adjust the Harvest Rate Scalars
                     (displayed in the Value box) with the mouse pointer.
                     Left-click and hold left and right arrows to adjust the
                     value, or click and drag the central slider to the
                     desired value.
<img src="usersa55.gif">   Value    Displays current value of the Harvest Rate Scalar for
            Box      that Year for the particular stock shown in the Stock
                     Select area and the fishery shown in the Fishery Select
                     area unless the Y, F, and/or S box is selected on that
                     line. These values persist between uses of the dialog
                     box if Apply or OK is chosen during this run of the
                     model.
<img src="usersa56.gif">       Y box    Check box used to set the Harvest Rate Scalars for a
                     group of years to a common value in the selected
                     Fisher(y/ies) and Stock(s). When selected, all checked
                     years are adjusted as a group to the shared value set
                     the next time any one of them is altered. The Y box at
                     the top of the column selects or de-selects the entire
                     range (all years) of Y boxes. This box can be used in
                     conjunction with other check boxes. The settings of the
                     Y boxes do not persist in-between uses of the dialog
                     box.
<img src="users2a.gif">       F box    Check box used to set the Harvest Rate Scalars for a
                     group of Fisheries to a common value for the selected
                     year(s) and the selected Stock(s). It is analogous to
                     the Y box described above.
<img src="users2a2.gif">       S box    Check box used to set the Harvest Rate Scalars for a
                     group of Stocks to a common value for the selected
                     year(s) and the selected fisheries. It is analogous to
                     the Y box described above.
<img src="users2a4.gif">   Help     Opens the Manual in a separate window.

<img src="users2a6.gif">   Reset    Resets the dialog box to the last applied values. Note
                     that this does not reset values to those from the input
                     files used when the program was first launched.
<img src="users2a8.gif">   Apply    Incorporates changes into the next model run.

<img src="users2a9.gif">   Cancel   Resets and closes the dialog box.

<img src="usersa11.gif">   OK       Incorporates changes in the next model run and closes
                     the dialog box.
<img src="usersa46.gif">  Forced   Only appears in the Catch Ceilings dialog box (Fishery
            box      menu). Used to make the modeled catch equal to the catch
                     ceiling even if the unconstrained catch is below the
                     ceiling. In practice, Forced catches are generally used
                     for the calibration period to force the catches to equal
                     the observed catches. Unforced catches are more likely
                     to be used for simulations.
