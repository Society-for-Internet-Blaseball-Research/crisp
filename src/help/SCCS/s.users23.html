<h1>2.3 -  The Map</h1>
</a>
The map shows the approximate geographic location of the 25 fisheries and 30 stocks used in the model. Fisheries are designated by boat icons<img src="usersa21.gif"> and stocks by fish icons <img src="usersa22.gif">. Remember that this model only contains chinook stocks and fisheries that are of concern to the Pacific Salmon Commission.<p>

For discussion purposes, mouse, pointer, and click operations are described for the default settings. As you become more comfortable with the model, you may want to alter them to suit your needs.<p>

<h5> Identifying Location</h5>
</a>
As the mouse pointer is moved over the map, the approximate latitude (LAT) and longitude (LON) of the pointer is given in the right portion of the status bar<img src="usersa23.gif"> (located below the map).<p>
