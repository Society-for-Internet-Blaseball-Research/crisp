<h2>Calibration</h2>

<p>
<i>CRiSP Harvest is calibrated against observed 
terminal run sizes, escapements or 
catches for individual stocks.</i> 
<p>
The model must be calibrated to produce useful results. CRiSP Harvest is calibrated by finding a suite of stock and year-specific brood year survival rates that results in model outputs that most closely match user specific terminal run sizes, escapements, or catches for individual stocks during the calibration period. CRiSP Harvest utilizes the same calibration algorithms as the PSC Chinook Model.
<p>
The user specifies the brood year survival rates for the simulation period, often taken to be the median, or the average, of the calibration period values. The model results are known to be sensitive to the selection of the EV scalars for the simulation period.
