<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>
<i>CRiSP Harvest has two modes of operation: 
scenario and Monte Carlo.</i>
<p>
CRiSP Harvest allows the operator to 
change parameters and view 
results interactively. Parameter 
values can be changed by using 
the mouse or keyboard. A 25 year 
simulation with 30 stocks and 25 
fisheries takes less than 10 seconds. Results can be presented in 
graphical form on the screen 
immediately after a simulation 
run, or can be downloaded to data 
files for archiving or further analysis.

<p>
The model can be run in two 
modes:
<p>
A scenario mode tracks cohorts 
through a single time series starting in 1979 and typically extends 
for 25 years. The period from 
1979 to the present is used as the 
calibration period. The operator 
must make assumptions about the 
future values of key environmental parameters, such as brood year 
survival rates and maturation 
schedules.
<p>
A Monte Carlo mode tracks 
cohorts through many time series. 
Each time series has a different set 
of values for key environmental 
parameters, such as brood year 
survival rates. These values are 
selected from previously observed 
values (bootstrapping) or drawn 
from a probability distribution. 
Results from Monte Carlo runs 
are used to study probability distributions of future stock escapements.
<p>
A graphical interface allows 
viewing and modification of variables and model outputs through 
an interactive map. Mouse clicking on stock and fishery icons permits easy access to parameters.
<p>
An analysis tool allows immediate graphical presentation of 
model results, such as stock abundances, terminal run sizes, escapements, legal fishery catches, and 
incidental mortalities. For Monte 
Carlo runs, histograms of stock 
escapements are prepared.
<p>
A report generation tool makes 
tables of model outputs for inclusion in documents. With SPARC-station software any graphical 
model output can be captured in a 
document. 
<p>
A help tool provides information 
about stocks and fisheries in the 
model.
